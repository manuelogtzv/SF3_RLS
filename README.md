**Code for estimating structure functions and KE transfers using regularized least-squares (RLS)**

1) calcSF_QGmodel: Runs two-layer QG Model, uses 15-year horizontal velocity outputs and
                                   estimate structure functions.
2) TwoLayer_QGModel_SFs_Fluxes: Uses the time series of structure functions to estimate PDFs,
                                                            and uses third-order structure functions to estimate kinetic
                                                            energy transfers and injection rates.
3) Drifter_SFs_Fluxes: Employs the drifter datasets generated by code in Balwada et al. (2022) to estimate
                                     structure functions, degrees of freedom, and kinetic energy transfer and their
                                     injections rates.
